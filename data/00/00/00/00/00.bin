  |   Enjoy the classic brain-teasing challenges offered by Chess but       |
  |   with entirely new rules and concepts to discover. Tactical Mind is    |
  |   one of the most innovative 1vs1 board games and you can now play      |
  |   the sequel - with 30 stages, enhanced visuals and brand new layouts   |
  |   to twist your perceptions!                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Face a real player in local multiplayer or dominate the AI in a       |
  |   progression-based Single Player campaign. Three different levels of   |
  |   AI difficulty are available, the hardest one being very smart!        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The aim of every match is to reach and disable your opponent's        |
  |   Crystal. Spawn pawns, place them wisely, level them up and outsmart   |
  |   the other player with the right moves...sound simple so far, right?   |
  |   Except you will have to share the Energy costs of any action with     |
  |   the other player! Whatever you do or purposely don't do will have a   |
  |   positive or negative Energy impact on your enemy's turn. That's       |
  |   where the real battle of the brains is. Ready to think carefully      |
  |   and show off your Tactical Mind?                                      |
  |                                                                         |
